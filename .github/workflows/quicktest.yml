  # Performs some quick tests.
  # This is a much quicker test suite which only runs the unit tests and linting
  # against the low/high supported PHP/PHPCS combinations.
  #
  # Performs the following steps:
  # - Checks out the repository.
  # - Configures caching for Composer.
  # - Sets up PHP.
  # - Installs PHPCS.
  # - Install Composer dependencies.
  # - Runs the Composer linting script (if desired).
  # - Runs Composer run-tests script.
